<h1>Glue</h1> is a toolkit that can make your life easier, unlike some other "nice" frameworks which have too much rigid assumptions, too many rules, too much boil plate codes, and too much design patten nonsense.
Currently my focus is about rich html/GWT + AJAX call to JEE server, because I believe that's the most powerful and simplest solution for the current JEE market. However I am sure it can help in traditional jstl+JSP project. With a plugin mechanism, its full capability is up to you!

Currently, the unique features of Glue are:

<h1>1 No interface for BO any more. </h1><br />
<h1>2 Auto wire your beans without any configuration or annotations.</h1> <br />
<h1>3 One transaction per request is provided by a hibernate plugin. And Yes you can easily create your own plugin</h1><br />
<h1>4 It also has a JSON plugin out of box which makes the communication between server and client so much easier.</h1><br />
<h1>5 If you want you can skip BO and DAO, just one controller can handle anything. There is no one size fits all. So there are no rules, only freedom and productivity.</h1><br />

let my codes prove my point: First please download the quickstart zip file
http://code.google.com/p/sw-toolkit/downloads/detail?name=glueTest.zip&can=2&q=
, it's a eclipse project. Simple run it and you will see a normal page about manging a entity called Student. check the code and it's very straight forward.

I am busy on a large project so can't write a comprehensive doc for this baby at this moment, leave comments if you have question!
